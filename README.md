Niluka Dilhani - Portfolio Website
Hello, my name is Niluka Dilhani. This project is my personal portfolio website, designed to introduce myself, my skills, my work, and my achievements to a wider audience. The website is a reflection of my professional journey and is intended to give visitors a clear understanding of who I am and what I can offer.

The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on clean design and easy navigation. It contains several key sections, including an About Me page where I talk about my background and passion for my field. There is also an Education and Activities section that highlights my academic achievements and extracurricular involvements.

I have dedicated a section to showcasing my technical and soft skills, giving a complete picture of my capabilities. The Portfolio section displays my previous projects, where I apply the skills I have learned and developed over time. I have also included a Latest News and Achievements area to share my recent milestones and professional highlights.

Visitors to the site can easily contact me through the Contact page, where I provide a form as well as direct contact details. My resume is also available for download for those who wish to learn more about my qualifications.

I believe that a well-designed portfolio is essential for making a strong first impression. Through this project, I aim to create a space that is not only informative but also welcoming and easy to explore.

For more about me or to get in touch, please feel free to visit my LinkedIn, GitHub, Instagram, or Facebook profiles. My email address and phone number are also available for direct communication.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio website.
